-> Two-Player Mode – Play with a friend! The game automatically switches turns.
-> Winner Detection – Checks for a winner or a tie after every move.
-> Restart Option – Reset the board and start a new match easily.
-> Winning Animation – The winning row flashes to highlight the victory.

Technologies Used
Python – Core programming language
Tkinter – GUI framework for designing the game window


 What I Learned from This Project?
-> Basics of Python programming
-> How to create a GUI using Tkinter
-> Handling button clicks and updating the interface dynamically
->Implementing game logic for checking winners
->Using global variables and event-driven programming
